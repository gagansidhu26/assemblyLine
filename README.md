# Assembly Line Simulation Project

During my time in the Object-Oriented Programming course at Seneca College, I led the development of an assembly line simulation using C++. The project involved creating a virtual assembly line with various stations, each responsible for specific tasks such as item handling and order fulfillment. The primary goal was to ensure the seamless movement of customer orders through the assembly line. The project was divided into three main parts, each focusing on different aspects.

## Contributions

- **Utilities Module**: Designed and built the Utilities module, responsible for reading input files and ensuring the overall functionality of the simulation.
- **Station Module**: Developed the Station module, which managed individual stations and handled the processing of orders.
- **CustomerOrder Module**: Created the CustomerOrder module, which tracked customer orders as they progressed through the assembly line, ensuring accurate fulfillment.
- **Workstation Module**: Implemented the Workstation module, defining the operational procedures of each station and the order processing flow.
- **LineManager Module**: Designed the LineManager module, responsible for setting up the assembly line and overseeing the movement of orders from start to finish.

## Skills Utilized

- **C++ Programming**: Extensively employed C++ to build the simulation, demonstrating proficiency in the language and its features.
- **Module Design and Implementation**: Designed and constructed various modules that interacted seamlessly to create a functional assembly line simulation.
- **File Handling**: Successfully managed the reading of input files, a critical aspect of the simulation's setup and operation.
- **Problem-Solving**: Applied problem-solving skills to address challenges in designing a complex system with interdependent components.

## Achievements

- **Functional Assembly Line Simulation**: Developed a fully operational assembly line simulation, showcasing a deep understanding of C++ programming principles.
- **Demonstrated OOP Expertise**: Highlighted the ability to design and implement intricate systems using Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
- **Enhanced Practical Skills**: Gained hands-on experience that improved practical programming and refined problem-solving abilities.

This project provided an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming in a practical context. It underscored my capacity to collaborate within a team to overcome challenges and deliver effective solutions.
